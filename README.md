## A code to create a database and count some statistics on it.

The file to run to get the result is [**words_database.py**](https://github.com/botvyns/database_words-statistics-/blob/main/words_database.py)

The number of parts of speech, number of declensions per part of speech, and td_idf are calculated for the four files downloaded with the .txt extension (fairy tales, poetry, history, and law).

The database is filled only with unique words (that is, without repetitions).

You can view the previous result in the [**result**](https://github.com/botvyns/database_words-statistics-/blob/main/result) file.
